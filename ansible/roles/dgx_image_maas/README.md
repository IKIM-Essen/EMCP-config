# Supplying the DGX OS image file

1. Obtain the ISO as described in the [DGX OS User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-os-5-user-guide/index.html#obtain-dgx-iso). Downloading the ISO requires an NVIDIA Enterprise Support account, which comes with every DGX purchase.

2. Create a `files/` directory at this level and place the DGX OS ISO file in it. The resulting path will be `files/DGXOS-*.iso`.
